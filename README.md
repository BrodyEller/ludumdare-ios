# Ludum Dare iOS Client

An iOS client for ldjam.com

# Current Status

The app currently only supports feed scrolling.  Post rendering is done with a UITextView and an NSAttributedString.  This will be changed since images do not follow autolayout constraints and extend past the edges of the screen if too large.
